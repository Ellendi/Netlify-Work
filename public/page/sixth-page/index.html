                    <p>SSL/HTTPS are both important because they are the ways the information between your web browser and website are
encrypted. Encryption means security, it gives you the piece of mind that whatever you are researching or looking
at is going to be secure from someone coming in and looking at it. While it is not foolproof or the security that
ends everything and is the best, it is there and is needed to keep you safe. Think of SSL/HTTPS as the layer of clothes
you wear outside. Sure, it is there and can be whatever you wish it to be but it keeps you safe from the sun because HTTPS
is your clothes but the SSL is the SPF built in to your clothes. You will still get sunburn but not as bad as it would
be if you ran around naked (that is why we have weird tanlines).</p>
