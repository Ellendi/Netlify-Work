Just a lonely girl living in a lonely world, taking the midnight shift of support going ANYWHERE!

Haha, sorry, I just had to. I'll be serious now. 

My name is Ashley, I'm 30 years old and I am a tech support guru, I will make sure your tech problems are taken care of.
I will research and explain it to you in a way that you can understand. I will not treat you like you are stupid.
Like a good neighbor, Ashley is there.
